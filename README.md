# Optum-Stratethon

Optum_Stratethon_2_Breast_Cancer model takes a csv dataset as input and predicts whether a person will have a malignant or benign cancer. By this prediction we can reduce the hospitalization and re-hospitalization risk.

This model uses all the Classification alogorithms and ANN with the following accuracys

Logistic Regression - 95.80%

K-Nearest Neighbors(K-NN) - 95.10%

Support Vector Machine(SVM) - 97.20%

Kernel SVM - 96.5%

Naive Bayes - 91.6%

Decision Tree Classification - 95.8%

Random Forest Classification - 98.6%

Aritificial Neural Network(ANN) - 95.8%

Optum_Stratethon_Diabetes model takes a csv dataset as input and predicts whether a person will have diabetes or not. By this prediction we can reduce the hospitalization and re-hospitalization risk.

This model uses all the Classification alogorithms and ANN with the following accuracys

Logistic Regression - 80.20%

K-Nearest Neighbors(K-NN) - 80.20%

Support Vector Machine(SVM) - 80.20%

Kernel SVM - 77.60%

Naive Bayes - 76.56%

Decision Tree Classification - 77.60%

Random Forest Classification - 72.39%
